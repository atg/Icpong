Icpong - play pong with the icons on your desktop

System requirements:

* Snow Leopard (probably, haven't checked)
* 13 icons on your desktop

# Known bugs
I'll probably be faster to say what *does* work, so I'll do that:

Working:

* Control the left hand side paddle with the arrow keys
* Collision detection (sort of)
* Computer player

The AI is in fact so bad that the computer player can never miss a shot.

If you feel like forking this, go ahead! Otherwise, you may use it for fun, or to complain about how the quality of code was better in your day.
